      I'm a student in Multimedia Nusantara University. I'm currently in 5th semester of Informatics Technique major. My name is Peter Gautama and I live in Ciledug, Indonesia. From years of my experience with computer, I always motivated to try something new and challenging. That is why I chose to take this major. I always wonder how people create a software / application, a game and still amaze in how those people influence nowadays society as we know it.

      <q>No matter what, you keep finding something to fight for</q> -Joel (Last of Us)<br/><br/>
      That is my favourite quote, which means that we should never surrender and always do our best in our lives. Always stay positive and
      hope for the best. That is how you live happily ever after. <br/>
